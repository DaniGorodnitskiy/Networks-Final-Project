Server Data Structure Definition:
---------------------------------
The server utilizes an in-memory Python Dictionary to manage active client sessions.
Database Type: Non-persistent (Runtime Memory).

Structure: 
    clients = { 
        "username_string": socket_object 
    }

Key-Value Mapping:
- Key: The unique username (String) provided by the client upon connection.
- Value: The active TCP socket object enabling direct communication with the specific client.

Application Layer Protocol:
---------------------------
1. Handshake: The first message sent by the client immediately after connection is treated as the 'Username'.
2. Message Routing Format: "TargetName: Message Body"
   - Delimiter: The server parses the string using the ':' character.
   - Lookup: The server searches for 'TargetName' in the 'clients' dictionary.
   - Action: If found, the server forwards 'Message Body' to the target's socket.
